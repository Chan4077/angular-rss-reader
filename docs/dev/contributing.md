# Contributing
To begin contributing to the app, follow either one of these methods:

## Method #1
Apply at the `Send Feedback` Google form, available under the sidenav.

It's at the last section of the whole form.

## Method #2
**NOTE:** The following code snippets are for macOS.
1. Click on the fork button at the [app's repo](https://github.com/Chan4077/rss-reader) to make a copy of the repo.
2. In your terminal, type the following code:
<!-- start-enclose-content -->
```bash
cd ~/Desktop # Or whatever place you would like the clone project to be placed at
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rss-reader.git
```
<!-- end-enclose-content -->
3. It should clone the project locally onto your desktop. In your terminal (once again), type the following code:
<!-- start-enclose-content -->
```bash
cd rss-reader
npm install # Installs all the dependencies
gulp docs # To create documentation
ng serve
```
<!-- end-enclose-content -->
4. Changes you make will be saved live.
5. After you're done making changes to a file(s), add the files to `git`, add a commit message and `push` it. (If you don't understand what I meant... Well, good luck.)
  1. For those who use Github Desktop, you should know how to do these simple stuff. Or else you're really screwed or you're a new user. Anyways, here's a [guide](https://example.com) on How-To Github Desktop.

Done!
