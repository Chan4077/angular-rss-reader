# Troubleshooting
The following guide below shows the typical errors and what you can do to solve it.

## RSS doesn't load
If the RSS feed app is stuck at loading, try reloading it again by clicking on the ![Options button](../img/troubleshooting/options_btn.jpg) button:

![Options](../img/troubleshooting/rss_feed_not_loading.gif)

Alternatively, the RSS feed URL you have entered is invalid or doesn't exist. In this case, just reselect the RSS feed by clicking on the options button and selecting `Reselect RSS feed`.

## App theme appears to be broken on startup
Yes, I know. I'll be working on a fix soon.

## My error is not listed above!
In that case, just submit an issue [here][issue_form] and I will try to fix the problem.
