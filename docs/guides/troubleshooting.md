The following guide below shows the typical errors and what you can do to solve it.

## RSS doesn't load

If the RSS feed page is stuck at loading, try reloading it again by clicking on the options button (shown below in the GIF).

Alternatively, the RSS feed URL you have entered is invalid or doesn't exist. In this case, just reselect the RSS feed by clicking on the options button and selecting `Reselect RSS feed`.

## My issue isn't listed!

In that case, just submit an issue [here][issue_form] and I will try to fix the problem.
